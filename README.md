1. Preprocessing.py may take up to 20 minutes as the training file is large. It will generate 6 csv files for classification using FFT, MFCC and DWT as the feature extraction methods.The outputs are training1, 2, 3 and testing1, 2, 3. </br>
2. Then run classify.py with those outputs for classification.</br>
</br>
  3. The libraries we used are: scikits.talkbox, sklearn and matplotlib. We also used Weka and Orange to help us testing the data.
