1. This project is impelemented with Python. The files contained in the project are:
	README.md
	preprocessing.py
	classify.py
	training1.csv // for FFT method
	training2.csv // for MFCC
	training3.csv // for DWT
	testing1.csv
	testing2.csv
	testing3.csv

2. Please make sure the training files are in the folder named: genres
And the testing files are in the folder named: validate

3. To process preprocessing.py, it may take up to 20 minutes. It will generate 
6 csv files for classification using FFT, MFCC and DWT as the feature extraction 
methods.The outputs are training1,2,3 and testing1,2,3. Thus we include the outputs 
which are ready to use. 

4. The libraries we used are: scikits.talkbox, sklearn and matplotlib

We also used Machine learning tools like Weka and Orange to help us testing the data.
